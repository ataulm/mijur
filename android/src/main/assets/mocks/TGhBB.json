He was born in Mamou, Louisiana on 3/3/1987.  His adoptive parents were named Harriet and Steve.\n\nEdit: Elijah is NOT his last name. Our birth mother gave us more names than we needed.  I opted to leave his surname off of his post.",

He had a really difficult life.  He and our birth mother had been estranged since 2006.\n\nHe took his life on 3/10/14.  Katie (birth mom) found me through a search angel in April, right before my 26 birthday.  We emailed back and forth, and she told me about all of her children.  When she told me Dylan's full name, I immediately googled him.  The first thing I found was his obituary.  I was one month too late.  My heart is broken that I'll never know him.  I'm hoping you guys will help me find Joshua so I don't miss out on his life.",

I was born on 4/6/1988 in Mamou, Louisiana.\n\n I'm begging you guys, to please help me find him.  Please be delicate, though.  He is an adult now, but I don't know if he knows he is adopted or if he wishes to know his birth family.\n\nI really appreciate you guys in usersub that have read this whole thing!  If any of you have questions about adoption and the reunion process, I'd be happy to share the full story with you.  Just send me a message.  Love you guys <3",
