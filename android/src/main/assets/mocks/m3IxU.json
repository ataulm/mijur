To avoid any structural damage caused by the movement of the tree, I made some sliding beam brackets. I ordered some special made 1'' x 12'' grade 8 screws to drill into the tree, imagine a half threaded screw but massive! The bracket looks like a wide horse shoe with square edges and a plate going across the top. The 1'' thick screw has a collar slipped over it that acts as a roller when the tree moves, and this is all inserted in to the bracket and screwed into the tree. I used a high strength anchoring adhesive to give a little extra hold and to keep water from entering the tree. ",

Did I mention the tree house has electricity, water, phone, cable, internet, and in-wall speaker wiring? The wall with the electrical panel was framed to hang a flat screen television, with power and cable outlets up high (it is the same wall that has the branch growing through, which is why it juts in).
