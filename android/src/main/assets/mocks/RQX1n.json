The reason for not wanting them is because the walls on the ponds are too steep for the ducklings to climb out of and they end up drowning. They are also killed by the other adult ducks drowning them or by predators so all in all its not really a good place for them to be.",

I left him until the end of the day incase his mother returned for him, but when she did not i retrieved the egg. If I had left him there I don't think that he would have survived the night as he had not managed to break much more of his shell open.",
