Where he was, how long he'd been on the job, the place, the smell; all like it just happened. \n\nMe, I was brand-new. Just off break in, I'd been an officer less than six months when I got this call. 21 years old, with all the heavy life experience you'd expect a white suburbanite kid to have (ha!). \n\nWithout further ado, here is my story:",

A different set of officers had been dispatched to the original incident the day before: The husband, whom we'll call DotCom; was a high level executive for a very successful company; had gotten into an argument with his wife; Ivanna. The argument started over DotCom disciplining their daughter, Paris; and escalated into an alleged domestic violence incident. \n\nIvanna claimed there had been physical violence, DotCom said there hadn't. I'm not sure I would have believed any of them. Regardless the responding officers never found any signs of it getting physical. What was undisputed was that DotCom had thrown Paris' cell phone in the toilet because he didn't like how much time she was spending on it. (Effective. Not very subtle. But effective.)\n\nRegardless of what exactly happened, Ivanna threw up her hands and said, \"Fuck it. I'm leaving.\" She packed a few bags, grabbed Paris; and they MOVED TO FUCKING HOLLYWOOD. Not \"I'm going to stay with my mother for the night, we'll talk about this tomorrow.\" Nope. \"Two First Class tickets please.\" BOOM! Moved. ",

He was surrounded by framed pictures of his wife and daughter, and several more bottles of liquor, much more empty than those left in the kitchen. His skin was red and purple, a combination of carbon monoxide poisoning and rigor. \n\nIt was the first time I'd seen a dead body on the job. I remember being struck at how unreal it felt. Almost like looking at a very well painted dummy in a haunted house. But your brain's screaming at you: \"This is fucking real!\" \n\nI had been staring for more than a few seconds apparently- my partner (who was older and had been coppin' for longer than I had) brought me back to the moment: \"Rawesome. Rawesome! We got to clear the rest of the house!\" \n\nThat snapped me out of it, and we got to work. The headache was already starting. We found no one else in the house, thankfully just DotCom. By the time we'd made our way back to the garage, the headache had come on in full force - hit me like a freight train. I could tell by looking at my partner - it had him too.  We were getting carbon monoxide poisoned too. \n\n\"Why aren't the car's running?\" my partner asked out loud, half to me and half to himself. We checked the BMW and the Range Rover - both keys were turned to \"RUN\" and the headlights on both were on. Perhaps they'd run out of gas?\n\nNope. Both still had over half a tank of fuel. They weren't running anymore because there wasn't enough oxygen left inside the garage to support combustion for the engines. ",

                "description": "That headache lasted for three days. It was the worst pounding I've ever experienced. But that image of DotCom: mouth distorted, skin purple, laying dead on the floor of a house that I'll never hope to afford, between two cars that each cost more than I made in two years; that image stayed with me for a long time after. For weeks I'd see his face when I went to sleep, and think about him several times a day. \n\nIt sounds hackneyed and trite even to me; but DotCom changed my perspective on life, love and money. Here laid a guy who owned more stuff than I could accumulate in three lifetimes, pulling a salary equal to what I would make in ten years, and he was unhappy enough to check out of this life. Wow. That was profound and heavy for a 21 year old kid, and it changed how I saw things. \n\nThanks for reading everyone. Take care of yourselves, and each other.\n\nSuicide isn't the answer, it leaves ripples far bigger than you can imagine: if you're thinking about hurting yourself, reach out, talk to someone. http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/\n\nPrevious Stories:\n---------------------------------\nAccidental Assault by Sex Toy http://imgur.com/gallery/fV4D0\nHighway Divider of Love http://imgur.com/gallery/k2ZWJ\nDeparting Party Hat http://imgur.com/gallery/lMjIP\nLarry Snickets and a Series of Retarded Events http://imgur.com/gallery/a8SJZ\nMary Poppins' Magical Purse http://imgur.com/gallery/h4BLz\nAlcohol Fueled Anarchy http://imgur.com/gallery/Qk5rD\nRainbows, Unicorn Piss and Fairy Tales http://imgur.com/gallery/M6KdQ\nThat Is Not My Fetish: http://imgur.com/gallery/f0irf\nKarma: Revenge From Afur http://imgur.com/gallery/tBDLJ\nPoppy the Penguin: http://imgur.com/gallery/VF7mD\nPlumbers, a Princess and a Pontiac: http://imgur.com/gallery/oY0YR\n\nAMA part 1: http://imgur.com/gallery/IcQ83\nAMA part 2:  http://imgur.com/gallery/wMZa9\nAMA part 3: http://imgur.com/gallery/V8DEi\n",
