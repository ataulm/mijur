But we need tools to be a good skeptic.  One of our best tools is logic.  ",

The last in particular, as they are actively trying to separate you from your money.  \n\nIf someone places their argument beyond refute, it may be because the argument can\u2019t stand otherwise.\n",

However, Plucky would have an easier time arguing against a child killer, and he changes Hamton\u2019s stance accordingly.
