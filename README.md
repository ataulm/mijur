# mĭjur
An Android client for Imgur. I'm using this as a project to learn about REST, custom UI components in Android, as well as UX/UI design for the Android and mobile platform in general.

## Imgur
[Imgur][imgur] is the go-to destination for viral images. Backed by a friendly and funny community, Imgur is the best place to spend your free time online. 

Users can interact with images by commenting and voting, or submitting their own image. The uploader makes sharing images with the Internet simple. You can use Imgur to share an image or album with a friend or post on a message board, blog or social networking site. You can manipulate the image to your liking and automatically share it with your social network of choice. Best of all, Imgur is completely free.
